# Contributing to ODK Central Frontend

## Contributing Code

### Vue

We use Vue.js along with Vue Router, Vuex, and Vue CLI.

### jQuery

ODK Central Frontend uses jQuery in limited ways.

Wherever possible, we try to use Vue instead of jQuery. Vue will not always know about or respect the changes that jQuery makes, and using jQuery can add complexity to a component. It can also add complexity to testing: for example, we generally use avoriaz for testing, but if you use jQuery in a component, then in testing, you may need to use jQuery's `trigger()` method rather than avoriaz's `trigger()` method.

That said, there are a couple of occasions in which we reach for jQuery:

- We use some of Bootstrap's jQuery plugins.
- avoriaz does not allow you to mock events. However, jQuery does, so we sometimes use jQuery in order to facilitate testing.

One thing to keep in mind when using jQuery is that you will have to manually remove any jQuery listeners and data, perhaps when the component is destroyed.

If possible despite our use of Bootstrap, we may wish to remove jQuery from Frontend in the future. For that reason, if you have a choice between using jQuery and vanilla JavaScript, you should consider using the latter. Remember though that as with jQuery, Vue will not always know about or respect the changes that you make using vanilla JavaScript.

### Bootstrap

ODK Central Frontend uses Bootstrap 3. (However, we are considering [moving to Bootstrap 4](https://github.com/getodk/central-frontend/issues/142). Let us know if that is something you can help with!)

Frontend's [global styles](/src/assets/scss/app.scss) override some of Bootstrap's, as do the styles of Frontend components that correspond to a Bootstrap component (for example, `Modal`). However, we tend to stick pretty closely to Bootstrap, and you should be able to use most of Bootstrap's examples with only small changes. If you are creating a new component that is similar to an existing one, you may find it useful to base the new component off the existing one.

We use some, but not all, of Bootstrap's jQuery plugins ([`/src/bootstrap.js`](/src/bootstrap.js)). We try to limit our use of Bootstrap's plugins, because they use jQuery, and jQuery tends to add complexity to components and testing in the ways described above. For example, if you use a Bootstrap plugin, then in testing, you may need to use jQuery's `trigger()` method rather than avoriaz's.

### Global Utilities

We define a number of global utilities as properties on `Vue.prototype`: see [`/src/setup.js`](/src/setup.js). In general, we try to minimize the number of global utilities: do not define a global utility simply to avoid importing to components. However, there are a few occasions in which a global utility may be useful:

- The utility accesses the component using `this` (example: `$alert()`).
- The utility is used in templates, which do not have direct access to imports.
- We mock or otherwise modify the utility in testing (examples: `$http`, `$logger`).

If a utility is used in a limited number of components, consider using a mixin instead of defining a global utility.

### HTTP Requests

We use axios to send requests. We set `Vue.prototype.$http` to `axios`, so components can use `this.$http` rather than importing `axios`. However, components rarely even need to access `this.$http` directly. Most of the time, to send a GET request, you can use the `request` module of the Frontend Vuex store; to send a non-GET request, you can use the `request` mixin. The module and mixin both accept options and complete common tasks like error handling.

### Presenter Classes

Many ODK Central Backend resources have an associated presenter class in Frontend ([`/src/presenters`](/src/presenters)). This class extends the [base presenter class](/src/presenters/base.js). When you use the `request` module of the Vuex store to send a GET request, then if there is a presenter class associated with the response data, the store will automatically wrap the response data within a presenter object.

### Learning About a Component

To learn how a given component works, one of the best places to start is how the component communicates with its parent component:

- Does the component have props?
- Does it have slots?
- Does it emit events?

### Component Names

We specify a name for every component, which facilitates the use of the Vue devtools. In general, we try not to use component names to drive behavior: in most ways, renaming a component should have no effect.

Most components are named according to the combination of a resource and an action or other descriptor, for example, `ProjectEdit` or `FormOverview`. The following are common suffixes:

* `List`. A component that lists resources of a particular type. The component often includes a table, an empty table message, text and buttons above the table, and one or more modals.
* `Table`. A table for a particular type of resource. A `Table` component should just be the `<table>` element and should not include an empty table message or other content.
* `Row`. A row of a `*Table` component.
* `Show`. A component that shows a single resource of a particular type.
* `Home`. A parent component of related components, for example, `SystemHome`.
* `Create` (or `New`). A modal used to create a new resource of a particular type.
* `Edit`. A component used to update an existing resource of a particular type.
* `Delete`. A modal used to delete an existing resource of a particular type.

### Vue Mixins

Each component may use one or more mixins. Each file in [`/src/mixins/`](/src/mixins/) exports a mixin factory for a single type of mixin. (We use factories so that the component can pass in options for the mixin. We don't use this pattern much anymore though, so we will likely change this when we move to Vue 3.)

### Router

We support a number of route meta fields, which we document in [`/src/routes.js`](/src/routes.js). The router ([`/src/router.js`](/src/router.js)) contains a fair amount of logic, which is driven largely by the meta fields.

We also store router state in the Vuex store (see [`/src/store/modules/router.js`](/src/store/modules/router.js)). Some router-related utilities are defined in [`/src/util/router.js`](/src/util/router.js), and components can access router-related methods by using the `routes` mixin ([`/src/mixins/routes.js`](/src/mixins/routes.js)).

### Internationalization

We use the Vue I18n plugin for internationalization. The plugin is configured in [`/src/i18n.js`](/src/i18n.js) and [`vue.config.js`](/vue.config.js).

ODK Central Frontend uses the translations stored in [`/src/locales/`](/src/locales/): there is a JSON file for each locale. The base name of each file must be a BCP 47 language tag, because we use the name to set the `lang` attribute of the `<html>` element. `en` is the fallback locale, and [`en.json5`](/src/locales/en.json5) is bundled with Frontend; other files are loaded asynchronously as needed. We also make ample use of single file component `i18n` custom blocks.

We also define internationalization-related utilities in [`/src/util/i18n.js`](/src/util/i18n.js).

In general in Frontend, we use kebab-case to name slots. However, when using component interpolation, name slots using camelCase. This seems a little more readable within locale messages. Also, if the slot corresponds to a message, this allows the slot and its message to have the same name.

Note that while Vue I18n supports date/time localization, we use Luxon to manage DateTime objects, including for the limited date/time localization that Frontend implements.

#### Transifex

We use Transifex to manage our translations. Our Transifex source file, [`/transifex/strings_en.json`](/transifex/strings_en.json), is pulled into Transifex after a commit to the master branch.

`strings_en.json` is formatted as Transifex [Structured JSON](https://docs.transifex.com/formats/json/structured-json). One benefit of Structured JSON is that it supports developer comments. However, Structured JSON is a different format from the JSON that Vue I18n expects.

We use a script to convert Vue I18n JSON to Structured JSON: [`/bin/transifex/restructure.js`](/bin/transifex/restructure.js) reads the Vue I18n JSON in `/src/locales/en.json5` and in single file component `i18n` custom blocks, then converts that JSON to a single Structured JSON file, `strings_en.json`. Run `restructure.js` from the root directory of the repository.

`restructure.js` adds developer comments to `strings_en.json` by reading JSON5 comments. To use JSON5 comments in a single file component, specify `lang="json5"` for the `i18n` custom block. For example:

```html
<i18n lang="json5">
{
  // Some comment about the "hello" message
  // Multiple comments are combined.
  "hello": "Hello, world!",
  // This comment will be added for each of the messages within "fruit".
  fruit: {
  	"apple": "Apple",
  	"banana": "Banana"
  }
}
</i18n>
```

Also note about comments:

- You can use comments in `/src/locales/en.json5`, which is parsed as JSON5.
- If you add a comment about a specific key to the top of `/src/locales/en.json5`, that comment will be added for the key whether it appears in `en.json5` or a single file component `i18n` custom block.
- `restructure.js` will automatically generate comments for any message whose path ends with `.full`, because such messages are used for component interpolation.
- Use JSON with comments, but do not use other features of JSON5, which our workflow might not support.

Before each release, we download all translations from Transifex and save them in [`/transifex/`](/transifex/). Transifex allows translations to be downloaded "for use" or "to translate." We use "to translate," because untranslated strings are included as empty strings; "for use" fills in untranslated strings with the source strings, which we would then have to discard. On the website, Transifex allows the translations to be downloaded "to translate" for an individual locale, but not all locales at once. To download all locales at once, use the Transifex client, specifying `translator` as the mode.

Once they are downloaded, we convert the Structured JSON files to Vue I18n JSON by running [`/bin/transifex/destructure.js`](/bin/transifex/destructure.js). `destructure.js` generates all locale files in `/src/locales/` other than `en.json5`.

To summarize the workflow:

- Use Vue I18n as you normally would, adding messages to `/src/locales/en.json5` and to single file component `i18n` custom blocks.
- Add any developer comments to the Vue I18n JSON.
- Run `restructure.js` to generate `strings_en.json`.
- `strings_en.json` is automatically pulled into Transifex.
- Before a release, download all translations from Transifex.
- Convert those translations to Vue I18n JSON by running `destructure.js`.

Finally, also note:

- While Vue I18n allows English messages to have three forms (zero, one, multiple), Transifex only allows them to have two (one, other).
- We use a Transifex [translation check](https://docs.transifex.com/translation-checks/setting-translation-checks#checking-for-custom-variables) to ensure that the variables in each English message also appear in the message's translations (and that the translations only use variables that are in the English message).
- For this and [other reasons](https://docs.transifex.com/formats/introduction#plurals), if a message uses a count variable, do not leave it out from the singular form of the message. For example, instead of `"1 apple | {count} apples"`, specify `"{count} apple | {count} apples"`.
- Do not use HTML in messages: use component interpolation instead.

#### Adding a New Locale

To add a new locale to ODK Central Frontend:

1. Add the locale to Transifex.
2. Add the locale to `locales` in [`/src/i18n.js`](/src/i18n.js).
3. If the locale pluralizes differently from the default, specify its pluralization rules in `/src/i18n.js`. If the locale does not have exactly two plural forms, specify the number of plural forms in [`/bin/util/transifex.js`](/bin/util/transifex.js).
4. Check that there is a flatpickr config for the locale. If there isn't one, create a GitHub issue in this repository or contact us on Slack.
5. Consider spot-checking the translations. In particular, check that messages used in component interpolation have been translated correctly.

Note that right now, the router will use the user's preferred language to load the locale, but it will only use the first subtag of the language. If/when we add a locale with multiple subtags, we will need to update the router.

### Styles

ODK Central Frontend uses Sass.

Frontend implements a set of [global styles](/src/assets/scss/app.scss). Beyond that, we use Vue single file components, so you will find a component's styles in the same file as its HTML and JavaScript.

Frontend does not use Vue scoped CSS. Scoped CSS seems a little ✨magical✨, making it actually harder to reason about components.

Instead of scoped CSS, use `id` and `class` attributes to style components:

- To avoid conflicts, prefix the value of an `id` or `class` attribute with the component's name (in kebab case).
- Do the same for any `class` attribute.
  - The exception to this is if the class is used in combination with an id or with another class that is prefixed with a component's name. For example, if a component named `ProjectOverview` uses a class for some links, the class can be `styled-link` instead of `project-overview-styled-link` if the links are selected as `#project-overview .styled-link`.
- If the root element of a component has an `id` or `class` attribute, its value should be the same as the component's name (in kebab case).

### Assets

#### Icons

We use Font Awesome for our icons, using IcoMoon to select a subset of icons in order to minimize the size. The font files are located in [`/public/fonts/`](/public/fonts/), and the CSS is [`/src/assets/css/icomoon.css`](/src/assets/css/icomoon.css).

To update the icons:

1. Click the "Import Icons" button in IcoMoon. Select [`icomoon.json`](/icomoon.json). When prompted, load the settings stored in the file.
2. Add Font Awesome.
3. Move the imported set above Font Awesome. (This should help preserve the icon order and minimize the diff.)
4. Update the icons.
5. Download the new font, then copy the files into the repository. You will need to update the paths in the CSS, and you may need to prettify the JSON file.

By following the steps above, you should minimize the diff. However, in the JSON file, you may still see changes for properties like `id`, `iconIdx`, `setId`, and `setIdx`. (I think these properties may change for the icons that were previously most recently added.)

### Standard Actions

Certain actions are standardized across ODK Central Frontend.

#### Standard Button Things

If the user clicks a button that performs a server-side action, then during the request:

* The button should be disabled. Related buttons, such as a cancel button, should also be disabled.
* A spinner should appear within the button.
* If the button is within a modal, then in most cases, the user should not be able to hide the modal.

Once the request completes:

* An alert should be shown indicating the result of the request. The alert should persist on-screen in the case that performing the button's operation also navigates to another page.

You can use `mockHttp().testStandardButton()` to test some of these things for a particular button.

#### Standard Form Things

* When a form is presented to the user, the first enabled field should be focused.
* Each field should have a label.
* For each field, the user should see a clear indication as to whether the field is required.
  * If a field is required, add an asterisk to its label and its placeholder.
* If the user submits a form with an invalid field, the user should be informed about the validation error.
  * If the user resubmits the form, and it is invalid for a different reason, the user should be informed about the new validation error.
